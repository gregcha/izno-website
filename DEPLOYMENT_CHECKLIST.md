# ‚úÖ Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Created GitHub repository (name: `izno-landing-page` or `izno-website`)
- [ ] Repository is set to **Public**
- [ ] Downloaded ALL files from Figma Make to local computer
- [ ] Verified folder structure matches the original

## Critical Files Check
- [ ] `package.json` exists
- [ ] `vite.config.ts` exists
- [ ] `tailwind.config.js` exists
- [ ] `postcss.config.js` exists
- [ ] `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` exists
- [ ] All component files exist in `/components/` folder
- [ ] **Note**: package-lock.json is NOT needed - it will be auto-generated

## Configuration Updates
- [ ] Updated `package.json` homepage with actual GitHub username
- [ ] Verified `vite.config.ts` base path matches repository name
- [ ] Repository name matches the path in config files

## File Upload
- [ ] Uploaded ALL files to GitHub repository
- [ ] Folder structure preserved (.github, components, imports, etc.)
- [ ] **Did NOT upload package-lock.json** (will be generated automatically)
- [ ] Committed with meaningful message

## GitHub Pages Setup
- [ ] Went to repository Settings ‚Üí Pages
- [ ] Selected "GitHub Actions" as source (NOT "Deploy from a branch")
- [ ] Saved settings

## Deployment Verification
- [ ] Checked Actions tab - workflow running
- [ ] No package sync errors (using npm install instead of npm ci)
- [ ] Dependencies installed successfully
- [ ] Build completed successfully 
- [ ] Workflow completed successfully (green checkmark)
- [ ] Site accessible at correct URL
- [ ] All sections loading correctly
- [ ] Styles applied properly
- [ ] Images/assets loading
- [ ] Contact form working
- [ ] Mobile responsive

## Post-Deployment
- [ ] Shared live URL
- [ ] Documented any custom changes
- [ ] Set up monitoring for future updates

---

**Live Site URL Pattern**: 
- If repo name is `izno-landing-page`: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/izno-landing-page`
- If repo name is `izno-website`: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/izno-website`

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Key Simplification
**Major improvement**: No more package-lock.json sync issues!
- The workflow now uses `npm install` which automatically handles dependency resolution
- package-lock.json is generated fresh during each build
- No need to manually create or upload lock files
- Much more reliable deployment process

## üöÄ Build Process
The deployment now:
1. **Installs Node.js 18**
2. **Caches npm modules** for faster builds
3. **Runs npm install** with legacy peer deps support
4. **Builds the project** with proper environment variables
5. **Deploys to GitHub Pages** automatically

This is much more robust than the previous approach!
